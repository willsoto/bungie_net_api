  @moduledoc """
  Well, we&#39;re here in Destiny 2, and Talent Grids are unfortunately still around.  The good news is that they&#39;re pretty much only being used for certain base information on items and for Builds/Subclasses. The bad news is that they still suck. If you really want this information, grab this component.  An important note is that talent grids are defined as such:  A Grid has 1:M Nodes, which has 1:M Steps.  Any given node can only have a single step active at one time, which represents the actual visual contents and effects of the Node (for instance, if you see a \&quot;Super Cool Bonus\&quot; node, the actual icon and text for the node is coming from the current Step of that node).  Nodes can be grouped into exclusivity sets *and* as of D2, exclusivity groups (which are collections of exclusivity sets that affect each other).  See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for more information. Brace yourself, the water&#39;s cold out there in the deep end.
